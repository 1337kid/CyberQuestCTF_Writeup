I downloaded all the files onto my PC. On inspecting "tinkle.jpg" using strings commad, I found a readble text (highlighted) and "JFIF", indicating the file is indeed a JPEG file.
![](2.png)<br/>

It wasn't possible to view the file or run exfitool because the file was corrupted. On opening the file with GHex, I noticed that the magic number was different. I was able to view the file when I changed (C3 BF FF E0) to JPEG magic number (FF D8 FF E0).

Then I ran Exiftool and the readable text which was found earlier turned out to be a comment. (it looks more like a password)
```
Comment                         : 11ilov3miles5Cjwk>}2sa#)83
```
On inspecting the files names, I found that when some of them are reversed, its readable.

```
namredips => spiderman
neb => ben
newg => gwen
```

Using "gwen" as username and "11ilov3miles5Cjwk>}2sa#)83" as password, I was able to login through SSH.

Inside gwen's home directory, there was a zip file that was password protected
#### SSH

I started a python http server in gwen's home folder, so that I could download the zip file on to my PC
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

#### My PC

After downloading, I used zip2john to extract the password hash then used JTR to perform a dictionary attack.
The password for zip file was "Cabbage"
<br/>

mec.zip contained 3 files. 2 text files and a jpg file.<br/>
"miles.txt" contained 2 base64 encoded stings and a text message
```

aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj03SFdmd0xCcVNRNA==
i like miles but i hate & and $
```

Decoding them led me to 2 YT videos. One of them contained a password "74k&^*nh#$" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HWfwLBqSQ4).<br/>
Password after removing "&" and "\$" : 74k^*nh#

With this password, I was able to extract a file using StegHide.

The password was splitted into multiple lines. Joining them gave "28milesAnGwen4Ever8b3-#Z65V%hU@dEeuRsd65". Using this as the password for root user, I gained root access and I got the flag.
